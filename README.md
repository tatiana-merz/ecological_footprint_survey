# Introduction to Ecological Footprint Survey
This project aims to study how big the footprint size of the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen students is. We chose gender as an independent variable. Thus, our research question is: does ecological footprint size differ across gender in the setting of University of Tübingen? We assume a null hypothesis for this research question. The study is conducted through a survey which has multiple choice and check-box types of questions. There **8** sections in the survey which are titled as **Water Use**, **Food**, **Transportation**, **Shelter**, **Energy Use**, **Clothing**, **Use of Stuff** and **Fun** respectively. These sections ease the participants to see on what kind of topics their ecological footprint size is calculated, and how their routines lead to their overall footprint size.

In the following part, we walk you through the use of the web application for the data collection, which is conducted via the metric, survey.
## Steps to Use the Platform

After clicking, you will be directed to **Footprint Survey** whose first section is **Background Questionnaire**, where we ask about some demographical questions such as age and gender. After you respond to these questions, please click on the **Next** button via which you will be starting with the actual survey. Here you will be answering questions related to **Water Use**. You choose between the options via the drop-down section for the answers of yours. You can choose only one option as the questions in this section are multiple-choice type.

Finished with **Water Use** section? Please click on **Next**. Now you will find yourself on the **Food Consumption** section, and compared to the previous section, you will see check-box type and drop-down type of questions where you make a selection. After you answer all the questions, you can proceed to the following section again by clicking on **Next**. Notice also that there is a button called **Prev** on the left-handside. This button will be in the other sections of the survey as well so that you can go to the previous section when you want to change something before submitting the survey.

The third section will be related to **Transportation**, and like in the second section, here there are also check-box and drop-down type of questions.

All the questions here are drop-down  type of questions. When done here, please click on **Next**.

In the fifth section, you will see that we want you to respond to the questions that are in relation to **Energy Use** and again in drop-down type where you make a selection. When done, click on **Next**.

The sixth section is **Clothing**. Please answer all the questions here which are all again in the type of drop-down. Click on **Next** to proceed. Then you will be in the **Use of Stuff** section, and here again we provide drop-down type of questions. When you complete this section, please click on **Next**.

If there is anything you want to change in your data, you can always go back to the previous sections via the **Prev** button **before submitting**. It is important to note **each question should be answered to be able to submit the survey**.

Notice also that once you click on the **Footprint Survey** to take the survey, on the top of the page, you will always see the navigation bars which are **Home**, **Footprint Survey** and **Contact Us**.
