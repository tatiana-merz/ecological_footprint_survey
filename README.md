# Introduction to Ecological Footprint Survey
This project aims to study how big the footprint size of the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen students is. We chose gender as an independent variable. Thus, our research question is: does ecological footprint size differ across gender in the setting of University of Tübingen? We assume a null hypothesis for this research question. The study is conducted through a survey which has multiple choice and check-box types of questions. There 7 sections in the survey which are titled as *Water Use, Food, Transportation, Shelter, Energy Use, Clothing, Stuff and Fun* respectively.
