# Introduction to Ecological Footprint Survey
This project aims to study how big the footprint size of the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen students is. We chose gender as an independent variable. Thus, our research question is: does ecological footprint size differ across gender in the setting of University of Tübingen? We assume a null hypothesis for this research question. The study is conducted through a survey which has multiple choice and check-box types of questions. There **8** sections in the survey which are titled as **Water Use**, **Food**, **Transportation**, **Shelter**, **Energy Use**, **Clothing**, **Use of Stuff** and **Fun** respectively. These sections ease the participants to see on what kind of topics their ecological footprint size is calculated, and how their routines lead to their overall footprint size.

In the following part, we walk you through the use of the web application for the data collection, which is conducted via the metric, survey.
## Steps to Use the Platform
First of all, when you go to our website, you will find yourself in our **Home** page where you can acknowledge yourself about the project under the titles of **Goal** and **Method**.

After clicking, you will be directed to **Footprint Survey** whose first section is **Background Questionnaire**, which is considered as a consent form. After you respond to these questions, please click on the **Next** button via which you will be starting with the actual survey. Here you will be answering questions related to **Water Use**. You choose between the options via the drop-down section for the answers of yours. You can choose only one option as the questions in this section are multiple-choice type.
