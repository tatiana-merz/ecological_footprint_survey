<p><b>Goal:</b> <p> Every individual can have a different life style; and as a result, it can affect the environment and the world we are living in.The aim of the study is to see how individualsâ€™ life styles can affect the ecology concerning the size of the ecological footprint and to see whether this rate of footprint size differs across the genders or not.</p>

<p><b>Method:</b></p>
<p> This study gives an insight into the sizes of the individuals' ecological footprint through the survey. It is a quantitative study for which we have included multiple choice and check-box types of questions. To be able to see if there is any ecological footprint size difference across the genders, it is important to have an equal number of data from the different genders. Furthermore, reaching out as many participants as possible for this study to be representative to some extent is essential. For this reason, convenience sampling is preferred. The participants can be all over the world as we do not take into account the nationality/country factor. However, our  participants are mostly university students as we, as the researchers, are currently university students as well. Therefore, what is convenient for us to reach the participants around us.</p>
